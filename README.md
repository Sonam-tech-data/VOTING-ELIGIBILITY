# VOTING-ELIGIBILITY# Voting Eligibility Checker

This is a simple Python program that checks whether a person is eligible to vote based on their age.

## ðŸ“‹ How It Works
- The program asks the user to enter their age.
- If the age is **18 or above**, it prints that the person is eligible to vote.
- If the age is **below 18**, it prints that the person is not eligible.

## ðŸ’» Code Example

```python
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

if age >= 18:
    print(f"You are {age} years old and eligible for voting.")
else:
    print(f"You are {age} years old and not eligible for voting.")
